# Data Driven HIV Prevention Among Young Adults in Uganda

## Project Summary:
HIV remains one of the most significant public health problems in Uganda with a prevalence of 6.7% among the population, it exerts a
heavy social and economic burden on the nation by lowering life expectancy, consuming huge sums of the national resource envelope and
taking a big toll on the social-circle well being of most families. HIV rates are high among the young at 9.7% . one of the major drivers of
this high prevalence among the youth is lack of awareness and understanding the extent of risk for infection resulting from risky social
behaviors.
The high usage of new technologies like mobile telephony and internet by young ugandans provides a unique opportunity to control the
HIV epidemic among the youth. In this project, we propose to innovatively leverage the triple competence of Artificial intelligence,
epidemiology and computer science to develop a tool that provides HIV risk score to young ugandans thus granting them awareness that
helps moderate health risky sexual behaviours. This solution will also link the young at high risk of infection to tangible interventions like
access to self testing kits, Prophylactic treatment and HIV prevention messages through the leading telehealth platform in the
country,TMCG

## Problem Statement:
HIV remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with the highest burden in Sub-Saharan Africa
[2]. In Uganda HIV still exerts a substantial toll on the national economy and family well being through early deaths, treatment expenses,
disrupted social structures and lost productivity. The highest HIV incidence and prevalence is among the youth [5], among the youth That
high incidence is mostly propelled by high risk behaviour among the youth [9], which is itself is largely driven by a lack of awareness of the
attendant weight of risk in their behaviour. That problem is compounded by limited access to information about the various options and
remedies available for prevention or for disease management in case of those that are infected. Even more, this sustained high prevalence
of HIV within this demography acts to serve as one of the major reservoirs for the disease, which is responsible for the persistence of the
prevalence of HIV with about 6.2%[1][3].
Worldwide, HIV risk assessment tools have been developed based on populations that are not generalizable to the African young adults. In
Uganda, The Ministry of Health uses scoring tool to identify high-risk individuals for screening persons eligible for pre-exposure
prophylaxis.

## Proposed Solution:
It is therefore critical to create a platform where youth can continuously and regularly assess their quantified risk for HIV acquisition (risk
score). Such a platform must also help youths access behavioural change messages, real-time HIV self-test services, and linkages to pre
exposure prophylaxis (PREP) for individuals at a high risk of acquiring HIV.
We propose to harness existing and increasing use of mobile telephony and internet among the youth, to create such a platform. We will
use highly reputed nationwide databases to extract variables predictive of high-risk sexual behaviour among the youth. The collected data
will then be used to develop a risk assessment tool customized for the young adult population in Uganda. That will be achieved through
deployment of machine learning methods to develop an algorithm that predicts the HIV acquisition risk for an individual. High risk youths
will then be linked to The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG), a leading telehealth center, to access preventive information and tangible
interventions like access to self-testing kits. From TMCG’s voice, social media and SMS platforms, respondents will receive customized
information on HIV risk reduction, access to HIV self testing, and PrEP services when required; in order to prevent HIV acquisition.

## Relevance:
The research and innovations solution proposed in this project will contribute to the attainment of the third global Sustainable Development
Goals (SDG) on good health and well-being by 2030. Technological innovations like the accurate prediction of the HIV risk score for an
individual are key to finding lasting solutions to the HIV epidemic in resource-constrained economies and ultimately improving the quality of
population health. They ensure “a healthy human capital through provision of equitable, safe and sustainable health services” as is
stipulated in the second National Development plan. As one of the key proposals of the Ugandan Science, Technology and Innovations
(STI) sector priorities, the research and innovation undertaken here will contribute to “enhancing the integration of science and technology
into the national development process”, which should ultimately contribute to improving Uganda’s ranking on the Technology Achievement
Index (TAI); an essential Performance indicator for Uganda’s NDP. Furthermore in terms of sectoral priorities, Uganda recently published
its ‘Consolidated guidelines for the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS’ in december of 2018. The guidelines have a strong component of HIV prevention modalities for especially those at high risk and how to link them to appropriate services including pre-
exposure prophylaxis for some
